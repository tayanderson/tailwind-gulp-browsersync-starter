## Tailwind Gulp BrowserSync Starter

#### A starter kit to get going with tailwind, gulp and browser-sync.

This starter kit gives you a [browser-sync dev server](https://browsersync.io), which comes pretty handy. Everytime you save a HTML file, your browser will inject new styles / reload the page for your convenience, so you can focus on what you're creating.

Customize the `tailwind.config.js` config file (only if needed!)

### Commands
`yarn` or `npm install` to install the required dependencies
`gulp` to kickoff the dev server, and open your browser window. Optionally you can run the following:
	* `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the development server
	* `yarn build` or `npm run build` to run a build without starting the server
5. Edit `index.html` in `./src/` and start creating!
